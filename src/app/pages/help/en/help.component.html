    <h4 class="mt-4">About us</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        MPG.PuRe is the institutional publication repository of the Max Planck Society (MPG). It is operated and further
        developed by the <a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.en/" class="link-info">Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Institutes (MPI) and other MPG institutions publish their scientific output on this platform.
        This includes the (descriptive) bibliographic data, but also numerous full texts and supplementary material.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system is based on the <a href="https://github.com/MPDL/INGe" class="link-info">open source software
            PubMan</a>, an application for publication data developed and made available by the MPDL.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Contact us</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The PuRe Support Team [mailto:pure-support&#64;listsrv.mpg.de] of the MPDL will be happy to assist you with any
        questions regarding the general use and operation of MPG.PuRe.</p>
    <p>

        For all questions concerning access to the full text of a specific publication, or errors/discrepancies in its
        content, the MPI concerned should be contacted directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In most cases, the local library is the best point of contact. If it is not clear which MPI created the relevant
        record, PuRe Support Team can also be of assistance.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Mailing list</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Interested MPG employees can subscribe to the
        <a href="https://listsrv.mpdl.mpg.de/mailman/listinfo/pure-users" class="link-info">PuRe Users mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This serves as a forum for internal MPG users of PuRe. It offers the opportunity to exchange questions and ideas
        with each other and with the MPDL about current use and future developments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, PuRe support uses this list to provide information about planned maintenance work or user meetings,
        for example. It is therefore an advantage if at least one person at each MPI is always registered here.

    <h4 class="mt-4">FAQ</h4>
    <hr>

    <h5 class="mt-4">What is MPG.PuRe?</h5>
    <p>
        MPG.PuRe (Publication Repository) is the institutional publication repository of the Max Planck Society (MPG).
        The Max Planck Institutes (MPIs) use it to publicly provide bibliographic information about their scientific
        publications (e.g., title, authors, publisher, etc.).
        In addition, PuRe supports the green open access route: full texts and supplementary materials (e.g., PDFs) can
        be uploaded directly and made accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks to indexing by search engines such as Google, Google Scholar, BASE, and OpenAIRE, the content in MPG.PuRe
        is easy to find and highly visible. Various interfaces also allow flexible reuse of the data — for example, on
        websites, reports, blogs, or the MPG yearbook.
    </p>
    <p>
        MPG.PuRe is a central service of the Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) and is based on the open-source software
        PubMan, which is continuously developed by the MPDL.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">What does the publication collection in MPG.PuRe include?</h5>
    <p>
        MPG.PuRe mainly records scientific publications from the Max Planck Society (MPG). The data entry and
        maintenance are handled exclusively by the respective Max Planck Institutes (MPIs).
    </p>
    <p>
        Many records include not only bibliographic information but also full texts or supplementary materials. Whether
        and to what extent such content is available is decided individually by each institute.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the selection of publications included as well as the provision of full texts are entirely the
        responsibility of the respective MPIs.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">Can I get an account for MPG.PuRe?</h5>
    <p>
        No login is required to <strong>search and read </strong>the publications available in MPG.PuRe — all publicly
        accessible content
        can be viewed freely.
    </p>
    <p>
        An account is only necessary if you want to enter or maintain data. Each Max Planck Institute usually has at
        least one person responsible for MPG.PuRe. New users can be registered by the MPG.PuRe support team — but only
        in
        coordination with the responsible person at the respective institute.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note: Persons who are not (or no longer) employees of the Max Planck Society generally do not receive
        access to MPG.PuRe.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">Who can enter publications in MPG.PuRe?</h5>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Institutes independently decide which workflow for data entry in MPG.PuRe suits them best.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often, local libraries handle the data entry, but staff from public relations, assistants, or secretariats may
        also be involved. In some institutes, scientists themselves enter their publications.
        Each institute determines individually who is responsible for data entry.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">I found an interesting publication. Why can’t I download the full text?</h5>
    <p>
        Whether a full text is provided and who may access it is decided by the responsible Max Planck Institutes.</p>
    <p>
        If no download option is offered, either no full text has been uploaded or access is restricted according to one
        of the following visibility levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&#x2022; Restricted: Access is only possible from the IP range of certain institutes or the entire MPG.</li>
        <li>&#x2022; Private: Access is exclusively reserved for persons with a moderator account of the respective
            institute.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In such cases, you can contact the responsible institute directly — for example, the local library. If it is
        unclear who is responsible, the MPG.PuRe support team will be happy to assist you.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">How do I search in MPG.PuRe?</h5>
    <p>
        For simple searches across all fields, there is a search box in the header — no login is required for this.
        Complex search queries can be created using the advanced search.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">Are research data also made available via MPG.PuRe?</h5>
    <p>
        Occasionally, research data can also be found in MPG.PuRe, but this remains the exception. MPG.PuRe is primarily
        designed and optimized for publication data.</p>
    <p>
        If you are looking for or want to publish research data, specialized research data repositories are usually more
        suitable. These are often discipline-specific.</p>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Society also operates its own research data repository: the Open Research Data Repository Edmond.
