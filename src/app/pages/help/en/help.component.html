    <h4 class="mt-4">About us</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        MPG.PuRe is the institutional publication repository of the Max Planck Society (MPG). It is operated and further
        developed by the <a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.en/" class="link-info">Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Institutes (MPI) and other MPG institutions publish their scientific output on this platform.
        This includes the (descriptive) bibliographic data, but also numerous full texts and supplementary material.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system is based on the <a href="https://github.com/MPDL/INGe" class="link-info">open source software
            PubMan</a>, an application for publication data developed and made available by the MPDL.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Contact us</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The PuRe Support Team [mailto:pure-support&#64;listsrv.mpg.de] of the MPDL will be happy to assist you with any
        questions regarding the general use and operation of MPG.PuRe.
    </p>
    <p>
        For all questions concerning access to the full text of a specific publication, or errors/discrepancies in its
        content, the MPI concerned should be contacted directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In most cases, the local library is the best point of contact. If it is not clear which MPI created the relevant
        record, PuRe Support Team can also be of assistance.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Mailing list</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Interested MPG employees can subscribe to the
        <a href="https://listsrv.mpdl.mpg.de/mailman/listinfo/pure-users" class="link-info">PuRe Users mailing list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This serves as a forum for internal MPG users of PuRe. It offers the opportunity to exchange questions and ideas
        with each other and with the MPDL about current use and future developments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, PuRe support uses this list to provide information about planned maintenance work or user meetings,
        for example. It is therefore an advantage if at least one person at each MPI is always registered here.

                        MPG.PuRe (Publication Repository) is the institutional publication repository of the Max Planck
                        Society (MPG). The Max Planck Institutes (MPIs) use it to publicly provide bibliographic
                        information about their scientific publications (e.g., title, authors, publisher, etc.). In
                        addition, PuRe supports the green open access route: full texts and supplementary materials
                        (e.g., PDFs) can be uploaded directly and made accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to indexing by search engines such as Google, Google Scholar, BASE, and OpenAIRE, the
                        content in MPG.PuRe is easy to find and highly visible. Various interfaces also allow flexible
                        reuse of the data — for example, on websites, reports, blogs, or the MPG yearbook.
                    </p>

                        MPG.PuRe is a central service of the Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) and is based on the
                        open-source software PubMan, which is continuously developed by the MPDL.

                        MPG.PuRe mainly records scientific publications from the Max Planck Society (MPG). The data
                        entry and maintenance are handled exclusively by the respective Max Planck Institutes (MPIs).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many records include not only bibliographic information but also full texts or supplementary
                        materials. Whether and to what extent such content is available is decided individually by each
                        institute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, the selection of publications included as well as the provision of full texts are entirely
                        the responsibility of the respective MPIs.

                    <p>
                        An account is only necessary if you want to enter or maintain data. Each Max Planck Institute
                        usually has at least one person responsible for MPG.PuRe. New users can be registered by the
                        MPG.PuRe support team — but only in coordination with the responsible person at the respective
                        institute.

                        Please note: Persons who are not (or no longer) employees of the Max Planck Society generally do

                        Often, local libraries handle the data entry, but staff from public relations, assistants, or
                        secretariats may also be involved. In some institutes, scientists themselves enter their
                        publications. Each institute determines individually who is responsible for data entry.

                        MPG.PuRe is primarily designed and optimized for publication data.

                        If you are looking for or want to publish research data, specialized research data repositories
