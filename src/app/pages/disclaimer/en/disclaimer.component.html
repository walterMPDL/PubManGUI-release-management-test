    <h3 class="mt-4">Legal Structure</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Max Planck Society is a non-profit research facility which is organized as a registered association. All of
        the institutes and facilities of the Max Planck Society are largely autonomous in terms of organization and
        research, but as a rule have no legal capacity of their own.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Foreign Language Pages</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        To the extent that parts of this Internet site are offered in languages other than German, this represents a
        service exclusively for staff and guests of the Max Planck Society who are not proficient in German.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Liability for Contents of Online Information</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        As the service provider of contents in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Digital Services Act, the
        Max Planck Society shall be responsible for any contents which it makes available for use in accordance with
        general legal provisions. The Max Planck Society makes every effort to provide timely and accurate information
        on this Web site. Nevertheless, errors and inaccuracies cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the Max
        Planck Society does not assume any liability for the relevance, accuracy, completeness or quality of the
        information provided. The Max Planck Society shall not be liable for damage of a tangible or intangible nature
        caused directly or indirectly through the use or failure to use the information offered and/or through the use
        of faulty or incomplete information unless it is verifiably culpable of intent or gross negligence. The same
        shall apply to any downloadable software available free of charge. The Max Planck Society reserves the right to
        modify, supplement, or delete any or all of the information offered on its Internet site, or to temporarily or
        permanently cease publication thereof without prior and separate notification.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Links to Internet Sites of Third Parties</h3>
    <p>
        This Internet site includes links to external pages. The respective provider shall be responsible for the
        contents of any linked external pages. In establishing the initial link, the Max Planck Society has reviewed the
        respective external content in order to determine whether such link entailed possible civil or criminal
        responsibility. However, a constant review of linked external pages is unreasonable without concrete reason to
        believe that a violation of the law may be involved. If the Max Planck Society determines such or it is pointed
        out by others that an external offer to which it is connected via a link entails civil or criminal
        responsibility, then the Max Planck Society will immediately eliminate any link to this offer. The Max Planck
        Society expressly dissociates itself from such contents.
